## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get `nestjs-jwt-auth` up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (v16.x or higher)
*   npm or Yarn
*   PostgreSQL database instance

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the `nestjs-jwt-auth` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DunyaErdin/nestjs-jwt-auth.git
cd nestjs-jwt-auth
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `login-api` directory (or wherever your main NestJS application resides) based on the `login-api/.env.example` file.

```ini
# login-api/.env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/nestjs_jwt_auth_db?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME="3600s" # e.g., 1h, 60m, 3600s
```

**Important:** Replace `your_jwt_secret_key` with a strong, unique secret for production environments.

### 4. Prisma Setup

Navigate into the `login-api` directory and set up Prisma:

```bash
cd login-api

# Generate Prisma client and apply migrations
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will create your database schema based on the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

### 5. Start the Application

You can now start the NestJS application:

```bash
# To run in development mode with hot-reloading
npm run start:dev

# To run in production mode
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

The API will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.


## üí° Usage Examples

This module provides core authentication functionalities. Here's how you might interact with the API:

### Register a New User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "strongpassword123"
}'
```

**Expected Response (Success):**

```json
{
    "message": "User registered successfully",
    "user": {
        "id": "uuid-of-user",
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "createdAt": "ISO-date",
        "updatedAt": "ISO-date"
    }
}
```

### Login User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "strongpassword123"
}'
```

**Expected Response (Success):**

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1dWlkLW9mLXVzZXIiLCJlbWFpbCI6InRlc3RAZXhhbXBsZS5jb20iLCJpYXQiOjE2NzgyNjkwMDAsImV4cCI6MTY3ODI3MjYwMH0.signature"
}
```

### Access Protected Route

Use the `access_token` obtained from the login endpoint in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/users/profile \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>"
```

**Expected Response (Success):**

```json
{
    "id": "uuid-of-user",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "createdAt": "ISO-date",
    "updatedAt": "ISO-date"
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Environment Variable  | Description                                        | Default       |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | Connection string for your PostgreSQL database.    | `(required)`  |
| `JWT_SECRET`          | Secret key used to sign JWTs.                      | `(required)`  |
| `JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME` | Duration after which the JWT expires (e.g., `1h`). | `3600s` (1 hour) |
